# Indexed Types <Badge text="TypeScript" type="warning" />

Image you have an interface ArtworkSearchResponse as API response type
```ts
interface ArtworkSearchResponse {
  artists: {
    name: string;
    artworks: {
      name: string;
      deathdate: string | null;
      bio: string;
    }[];
  }[];
}
```
somehow you want to use the artworks type, you can duplicate yourself like this
```ts
interface Artwork {
  name: string;
  deathdate: string | null;
  bio: string;
}
```
However, since it's API response, once data structure changed, this hard-written code is causing bugs. We use indexed types to solve this problem

```ts
type InferredArtwork = ArtworkSearchResponse["artists"][0]["artworks"][0];

// The InferredArtwork is generated by looking through the
// type's properties and giving a new name to the subset which
// you have indexed.
```
