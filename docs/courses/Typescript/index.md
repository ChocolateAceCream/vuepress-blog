# Learning Typescript in a week

Daily plan as followed, then I'd like to read the source code of a famous project: React/ElementPlus/MUI

## Plan:

### 🗓️ Day 1: Getting Started with TypeScript
- [ ] Install TypeScript globally: `npm install -g typescript`
- [ ] Set up a basic TS project: `tsc --init`
- [ ] Compile a `.ts` file using `tsc`
- [ ] Understand the benefits of TypeScript over JavaScript
- [ ] Read: [The official TS handbook (Basic Types)](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html)

---

### 🗓️ Day 2: Type System Basics
- [ ] Learn basic types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `any`, `unknown`, `void`, `null`, `undefined`
- [ ] Practice arrays and tuples: `number[]`, `[string, number]`
- [ ] Understand `enum` and when to use it
- [ ] Learn how to use `type` and `interface`

---

### 🗓️ Day 3: Functions and Type Inference
- [ ] Learn function parameter and return type annotations
- [ ] Understand default and optional parameters
- [ ] Practice writing arrow functions with types
- [ ] Understand how TypeScript infers types

---

### 🗓️ Day 4: Object Types & Interfaces
- [ ] Define and use interfaces for objects
- [ ] Learn interface extension and composition
- [ ] Compare `type` vs `interface`
- [ ] Use `readonly` and `?` modifiers

---

### 🗓️ Day 5: Advanced Types & Generics
- [ ] Understand union and intersection types
- [ ] Learn about literal types and type narrowing
- [ ] Intro to generics: `<T>`
- [ ] Use generic functions and constraints

---

### 🗓️ Day 6: TypeScript with JavaScript Projects
- [ ] Convert a small JS project to TS (e.g., a todo app)
- [ ] Set up `tsconfig.json` properly
- [ ] Learn about declaration files and working with JS libraries
- [ ] Use DefinitelyTyped: `npm i @types/<package>`

---

### 🗓️ Day 7: Tooling & Real-World Use
- [ ] Set up ESLint + Prettier with TypeScript
- [ ] Use TypeScript with a framework (e.g., React or Node.js)
- [ ] Learn about `ts-node` and running TS directly
- [ ] Explore TypeScript + MUI or your current stack
